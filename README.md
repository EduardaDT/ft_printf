# ft_printf
42 Project

This project aims to recreate the printf() function from the standard library in the C language. The printf() function is commonly used to print formatted data to the standard output (typically the console).
<br>

## Objective

<br>
The main goal of this project is to understand and reconstruct the internal workings of the printf() function. By rebuilding this function, it becomes possible to gain a deeper understanding of string formatting concepts, variable argument handling, and data output management.
<br>

## Base Implementation

 - Simple Formats: Support for basic formatting, such as %s, %d, %c, %p, %x, among others.
 - Variable Arguments: Handling of a variable number of arguments passed to the function.
 - Output Control: Printing formatted data to the standard output.
